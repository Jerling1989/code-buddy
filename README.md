# code-buddy
For this project I made my own version of web apps like "CodePen" or "JS Bin". I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build out the design and functionality of the app. I had a lot of fun tinkering with several design aspects of the site including things like the different code colors, container badges, background color, logo, and more.
