# code-buddy
For this project I made my own version of web apps like "CodePen" or "JS Bin". I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build out the design and functionality of the app. I had a lot of fun tinkering with several design aspects of the site including things like the different code colors, container badges, background color, logo, and more.

- This first image shows what the user will see upon first loading the site. The only two tabs that are automatically open upon page load are the HTML Container and the Results Container. The HTML code is prefilled with the traditional "Hello World!" output.

- If the user were to test the app at this point by clicking the "RUN CODE" button, they would be assured that everything is copacetic by the "Hello World!" heading displayed in the Results Container.

- This image is a great display of what happens when the user decides to take advantage of what this tool is meant to provide. Once a new container is opened, like the CSS Container, all of the open containers automatically adjust width to take up equal room on the page. In this example the H1 tag was wrapped in a div with a unique id and some custom CSS styling was added to both of them, manifesting in the results tab once the "RUN CODE" button is hit again.
